        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <p>Satelite Internet is a form of high-speed Internet service. Satelite Internet service utilize telecommunications satellites in Earth orbit to provide Internet services to the whole world by connecting the internationl networks. Internet overSatellite (IoS) allows a user to access the Internet via a satellite that orbits the Earth. A satellite is placedat a static point above the Earth`s surface, in a fixed position because of the enormous distances signal must travel from the Earth up to the satellite and back again. IoS is slightly slower than high-speed terrestrial connectins over copper or fiber optic cables. Satellite Internet service covers areas where DS Landcable access is unavailable.
